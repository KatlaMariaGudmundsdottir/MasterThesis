	abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

	abstract = {In 2011, CERN's Controls Middleware (CMW) team started a new project aiming to design and implement a new generation equipment access framework using modern, open-source products. After reviewing several communication libraries [1], ZeroMQ [2] was chosen as the transport layer for the new communication framework. The main design principles were: scalability, flexibility, easy to use and maintain. Several core ZeroMQ patterns were employed in order to provide reliable, asynchronous communication and dispatching of messages. The new product was implemented in Java and C++ for client and server side. It is the core middleware framework to control all CERN accelerators and the future GSI FAIR [3] complex. This paper presents the overall framework architecture; choices and lessons learnt while designing a scalable solution; challenges faced when designing a common API for two languages (Java and C++) and operational experience from using the new solution at CERN for 3 years. The lessons learnt and observations made can be applied to any modern software library responsible for fast, reliable, scalable communication and processing of many concurrent requests.},

In this paper, a vision-based shape sensing algorithm for real-time 3D reconstruction of catheters based on the views of two arbitrary positioned cameras is presented. Customized high-speed algorithms are developed for the segmentation and feature extraction from the images. The algorithm is experimentally validated for accuracy by measuring the tip position, bending and orientation angles and for precision by estimating known 3D circular and elliptical shapes of the catheter. Experimental results demonstrate good accuracy and performance of the proposed high speed algorithms.},

In order to address this fundamental shortcoming in minimally invasive surgery, we describe the first prototype of a bioinspired multipart probe that can steer along planar trajectories within a compliant medium by means of a novel “programmable bevel,” where the steering angle becomes a function of the offset between interlocked probe segments. A kinematic model of the flexible probe and programmable bevel arrangement is derived. Several parameters of the kinematic model are then calibrated experimentally with a fully functional scaled-up prototype, which is 12 mm in diameter. A closed-loop control strategy with feed-forward and feedback components is then derived and implemented in vitro using an approximate linearization strategy that was first developed for car-like robots. Experimental results demonstrate satisfactory 2-D trajectory following of the prototype (0.68 mm tracking error, with 1.45 mm standard deviation) using an electromagnetic position sensor that is embedded at the tip of the probe.},

For a tissue that is not stiff relative to the needle, the tissue deformation caused by needle insertion deviates the needle tip position from a constant curvature path. The proposed model is obtained by replacing the bicycle wheels with omnidirectional wheels that move in two orthogonal directions independently. Such wheels can move sideways, providing a means for modeling the deviations of the needle tip from a constant curvature path by incorporating new parameters in the model. Using an experimental setup, the needle is inserted into soft phantom tissue at different constant velocities and model parameters are fitted to experimental data. The model is verified by comparing the results from the model to empirical data.},

The methodology adopted for path following control deals explicitly with vehicle dynamics and plant parameter uncertainty. Furthermore, it overcomes stringent initial condition constraints that are present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature. This is done by controlling explicitly the rate of progression of a "virtual target" to be tracked along the path, thus bypassing the problems that arise when the position of the virtual target is simply defined by the projection of the actual vehicle on that path. The nonlinear adaptive control law proposed yields convergence of the (closed loop system) path following error trajectories to zero. Controller design relies on Lyapunov theory and backstepping techniques. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the control system proposed.},

It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Worldwide disparities in the provision of surgical care result in otherwise preventable disability and death. There is a growing need to quantify the global burden of neurosurgical disease specifically, and the workforce necessary to meet this demand. METHODS Results from a multinational collaborative effort to describe the global neurosurgical burden were aggregated and summarized. First, country registries, third-party modeled data, and meta-analyzed published data were combined to generate incidence and volume figures for 10 common neurosurgical conditions. Next, a global mapping survey was performed to identify the number and location of neurosurgeons in each country. Finally, a practitioner survey was conducted to quantify the proportion of disease requiring surgery, as well as the median number of neurosurgical cases per annum. The neurosurgical case deficit was calculated as the difference between the volume of essential neurosurgical cases and the existing neurosurgical workforce capacity. RESULTS Every year, an estimated 22.6 million patients suffer from neurological disorders or injuries that warrant the expertise of a neurosurgeon, of whom 13.8 million require surgery. Traumatic brain injury, stroke-related conditions, tumors, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy constitute the majority of essential neurosurgical care worldwide. Approximately 23,300 additional neurosurgeons are needed to address more than 5 million essential neurosurgical cases—all in low- and middle-income countries—that go unmet each year. There exists a gross disparity in the allocation of the surgical workforce, leaving large geographic treatment gaps, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. CONCLUSIONS Each year, more than 5 million individuals suffering from treatable neurosurgical conditions will never undergo therapeutic surgical intervention. Populations in Africa and Southeast Asia, where the proportion of neurosurgeons to neurosurgical disease is critically low, are especially at risk. Increasing access to essential neurosurgical care in low- and middle-income countries via neurosurgical workforce expansion as part of surgical system strengthening is necessary to prevent severe disability and death for millions with neurological disease.},

	abstract = {We present a direct and an indirect nonlinear adaptive path-following controller for marine craft based on a line-of-sight guidance principle used by ancient navigators. The control laws are implemented using hydro-acoustic relative velocity measurements as opposed to absolute velocity measurements. For this purpose, a kinematic model for relative velocity in amplitude-phase form is derived. The first contribution is an adaptive indirect controller based on a disturbance observer designed for estimation and compensation of ocean currents. The equilibrium points of the cross-track and parameter estimation errors are proven to be globally κ exponentially stable. This guarantees that the estimated drift term converges to its true value exponentially. The observer is used in conjuncture with a control law to obtain asymptotic tracking and path following in the presence of ocean currents. The second contribution is a direct adaptive integral line-of-sight controller for path following. Global convergence of the cross-track error is proven by using Barbălat's lemma, which ensures that the parameter estimation error is bounded. Both methods can be applied to the horizontal-plane motion of surface vessels and autonomous underwater vehicles. An autonomous underwater vehicle case study is included to verify the results.

The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space).

Here, global, asymptotical stability with exponential convergence is achieved about any desired configuration by using a nonsmooth, time-varying feedback control law. The control law depends, in addition to the state and time, on a function which is constant except at predefined instants of time where the function is recomputed as a nonsmooth function of the state.

	url = {https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/259494},
	abstract = {A mix between a monograph and an article collection, this PhD thesis considers the concept of guided motion control for marine vehicles, in particular focusing on underactuated marine surface vehicles. The motion control scheme is defined to involve the combination of a guidance system which issues meaningful velocity commands with a velocity control system which has been specifically designed to take vehicle maneuverability and agility constraints into account when fulfilling these commands such that a given motion control objective can be achieved in a controlled and feasible manner without driving the vehicle actuators to saturation.

Furthermore, motion control scenarios are classified in a novel way according to whether they involve desired motion which has been defined a priori or not. Consequently, in addition to the classical scenarios of point stabilization, trajectory tracking, path following and maneuvering, the so-called target tracking scenario is considered. The resulting scenarios then involve target tracking, path following, path tracking and path maneuvering. In addition, it is proposed to define the control objectives associated with each scenario as work-space tasks instead of configurationspace tasks. Such a choice seems better suited for practical applications, since most vehicles operate in an underactuated configuration exposed to some kind of environmental disturbances.

The thesis also proposes a novel mechanization of constant bearing guidance, which is a classical guidance principle well-known in the guided missile literature. This suggestion is motivated by a need to solve the target tracking motion control objective for marine vehicles. The proposed implementation enables explicit specification of the transient rendezvous behavior toward the target by selection of two intuitive tuning parameters.

In addition, a singularity-free guidance law applicable to path following scenarios involving regularly parameterized paths which do not need to be arc-length parameterized is proposed. An extension to this guidance law is also suggested in order to enable off-path traversing of regularly parameterized paths for formation control purposes.

A novel velocity control system which inherently takes maneuverability, agility and actuator constraints into account is developed for the purpose of controlling underactuated marine vehicles moving at high speed. The system is derived through a design method which involves a control-oriented modeling approach and requires a minimum of system identification tests to be carried out.

The thesis also gives a novel overview of the major developments in marine control systems as seen from a Norwegian perspective. The development can be viewed as three waves of control, where the first wave concerned development of novel ship automation technology in the 1960s and 1970s, the second wave involved development of unique dynamic positioning systems in the 1970s and 1980s, while the third wave is expected to encompass the development of unmanned vehicle technology for a large number of maritime applications.

A summary of the historical development, present status and future possibilities associated with unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is also given. Current Norwegian activities are particularly emphasized.

Furthermore, an overview of the main formation control concepts applicable to marine surface vehicles is given. A novel formation control functionality named coordinated target tracking is subsequently suggested within a leader-follower framework. Employing a guided motion control system using the suggested mechanization of constant bearing guidance, this functionality is then implemented for two different types of underactuated USVs such that they are able to move in formation with a leader vessel which can maneuver freely without being constrained to any predefined motion pattern.

In particular, excerpts from successful full-scale formation control experiments involving a manned leader vessel and the two USVs executing coordinated target tracking at high speed are presented. This functionality currently seems to be unique on a worldwide basis, providing a convenient plug-and-play formation control capability for manned leader vessels involved in maritime survey operations.},

The proposed algorithm for the path tracking guarantees, under specified assumptions, that the tracking error, both in position and in attitude, asymptotically tends to zero. The work has been carried out with reference to the UAV of the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA).

Then, aiming at the problem of large tracking error caused by fixed forward-looking distance in traditional line-of-sight (LOS) guidance algorithm, we introduce a function of cruise speed, cross-tracking error, path curvature and turning radius of the vessel to adjust the forward-looking distance adaptively. In addition, a guiding law is designed to compensate for the navigation error caused by the time-varying sideslip angle, and the angle can be accurately estimated online based on ESO.

This results in a more flexible maneuvering behavior that can contribute to reaching the desired path faster as well as obtaining a diminished oscillatory behavior around the desired path. The guidance system along with a heading controller form a cascaded structure, which is shown to be κ-exponentially stable when the control task is to converge to the path produced by the aforementioned CHSI method. In addition, the issue of compensating for the sideslip angle β is discussed and a new κ-exponentially stable integral LOS guidance law, capable of eliminating the effect of constant external disturbances for straight-line path following, is derived.},

They come with different trade-offs in the sense of performance, scalability implications, and security. Message passing is more favorable for distributed systems, where isolation is good, while shared memory is better suited to multi-core environments for low latency access. We compare both methods in various systems and applications, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and the challenges that they face when there is possible synchronization, memory management, and latency.

To date, several novel needle steering systems have been developed to improve both the accuracy and applicability of this type of surgery, but many of these can still only provide limited control of the trajectory between an entry site and a deep seated target. Our previous work describes the first prototype of a bio-inspired multi-part needle, codenamed STING, which can steer along planar trajectories within a compliant medium by means of a novel programmable bevel, where the steering angle is a function of the offset between interlocked needle segments. This paper presents our first attempt to model a bio-inspired 4-part needle, an extension of the planar steering system with the potential to steer along three-dimensional (3D) trajectories within a compliant medium. This paper introduces a 3D kinematic model and closed-loop controller for the needle, which is inspired by the modeling strategy employed for under-actuated underwater vehicles, followed by simulation results which demonstrate that 3D trajectory tracking can be completed successfully.},

In general, the control strategies employed to drive the insertion use simplified kinematic models, providing limited control of the trajectory between an entry site and a deep seated target in cases of unmodelled tissue-needle dynamics. In this work, we present the first Adaptive Path-Following (APF) controller for a bio-inspired multi-part needle, able to steer along three-dimensional (3D) paths within a compliant medium by means of the cyclical motion of interlocked segments and without the need for duty-cycle spinning along the insertion axis. The control strategy is outlined in two parts: a high-level controller, which provides driving commands to follow a predefined 3D path smoothly; and a low-level controller, able to counteract unmodelled tissue-needle nonlinearities and kinematic model uncertainties. A simulation that mimics the needle's mechanical behavior during insertion is achieved by using an Experimental Fitting Model (EFM), obtained from previous experimental trials. The Simulation results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the proposed control strategy.},

	abstract = {Path following and follow-the-leader motion is particularly desirable for minimally-invasive surgery in confined spaces which can only be reached using tortuous paths, e.g. through natural orifices. While path following and followthe- leader motion can be achieved by hyper-redundant snake robots, their size is usually not applicable for medical applications. Continuum robots, such as tendon-driven or concentric tube mechanisms, fulfill the size requirements for minimally invasive surgery, but yet follow-the-leader motion is not inherently provided. In fact, parameters of the manipulator's section curvatures and translation have to be chosen wisely a priori. In this paper, we consider a tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. After reformulating the forward kinematics model, we formulate prerequisites for follow-the-leader motion and present a general approach to determine a sequence of robot configurations to achieve follow-the-leader motion along a given 3D path. We evaluate our approach in a series of simulations with 3D paths composed of constant curvature arcs and general 3D paths described by B-spline curves. Our results show that mean path errors {\textless};0.4mm and mean tip errors {\textless};1.6mm can theoretically be achieved for constant curvature paths and {\textless};2mm and {\textless};3.1mm for general B-spline curves respectively.},

	abstract = {Concentric tube robots offer the capability of follow-the-leader motion, which is desirable when navigating in cluttered environments, such as in minimally invasive surgery or in-situ inspections. The follow-the-leader capabilities identified in the existing literature, however, are limited to trajectories with piecewise constant-curvature segments or piecewise helical segments. A complete study of follow-the-leader kinematics is, therefore, relevant to determine the full potential of these robots, and clarify an open question. In this paper, a general analysis of follow-the-leader motion is presented, and a closed-form solution to the complete set of trajectories where follow-the-leader is possible under the assumption of no axial torsion of the tubes composing the robot is derived. For designs with constant-stiffness tubes, the precurvatures required are found to be either circumference arcs, helices, or deformed helices with exponentially varying curvature magnitude. The analysis developed also elucidates additional motions of interest, such as the combination of follow-the-leader motion in a robot segment with general maneuvers in another part. To determine the applicability of the assumption regarding the tubes’ torsion, the general equilibrium of the robot designs of interest is considered, and a closed-form solution to torsion in two-tube robots with helical precurvatures is derived. Criteria to select a desired torsional behavior are then extracted. This enables one to identify stable trajectories where follow-the-leader is possible, for potential application to minimally invasive surgery. An illustrative case study involving simulation and experiment is conceived using one of these trajectories, and the results are reported, showcasing the research.},

Disruptions to this network manifest as neurological or psychiatric conditions. Despite decades of neuroscience research, our ability to treat or even to understand these conditions is limited by the capability of tools to probe the signalling complexity of the nervous system. Although orders of magnitude smaller and computationally faster than neurons, conventional substrate-bound electronics do not recapitulate the chemical and mechanical properties of neural tissue. This mismatch results in a foreign-body response and the encapsulation of devices by glial scars, suggesting that the design of an interface between the nervous system and a synthetic sensor requires additional materials innovation. Advances in genetic tools for manipulating neural activity have fuelled the demand for devices that are capable of simultaneously recording and controlling individual neurons at unprecedented scales. Recently, flexible organic electronics and bio- and nanomaterials have been developed for multifunctional and minimally invasive probes for long-term interaction with the nervous system.

The first family of primitives consists of a time-delay dependent 3D circular path between two points in space and the control inputs required to fly the path. In particular, the control inputs are calculated using algebraic equations which depend on the flight parameters and the location of the waypoint. Moreover, the transition between successive maneuver states, where each state is defined by a unique combination of constant control inputs, is modeled rigorously as an instantaneous switch between the two maneuver states following a time delay which is directly related to the agility of the robotic aircraft. The second family consists of aggressive turn-around (ATA) maneuvers which the robot uses to retreat from impenetrable pockets of obstacles. The ATA maneuver consists of an orchestrated sequence of three sets of constant control inputs. The duration of the first segment is used to optimize the ATA for the spatial constraints imposed by the turning volume. The motion primitives are validated experimentally and implemented in a simulated receding horizon control (RHC)-based motion planner. The paper concludes with inverse-design pointers derived from the primitives.},

	abstract = {Purpose
In the context of minimally invasive neurosurgery, steerable needles such as the one developed within the Horizon2020-funded EDEN2020 project (Frasson et al. in Proc Inst Mech Eng Part H J Eng Med 224(6):775–88, . 10.1243/09544119JEIM663; Secoli and y Baena in IEEE international conference on robotics and automation, ) aspire to address the clinical challenge of better treatment for cancer patients. The direct, precise infusion of drugs in the proximity of a tumor has been shown to enhance its effectiveness and diffusion in the surrounding tissue (Vogelbaum and Aghi in Neuro-Oncology 17(suppl 2):ii3–ii8, . 10.1093/neuonc/nou354). However, planning for an appropriate insertion trajectory for needles such as the one proposed by EDEN2020 is challenging due to factors like kinematic constraints, the presence of complex anatomical structures such as brain vessels, and constraints on the required start and target poses.

Methods
We propose a new parallelizable three-dimensional (3D) path planning approach called Adaptive Hermite Fractal Tree (AHFT), which is able to generate 3D obstacle-free trajectories that satisfy curvature constraints given a specified start and target pose. The AHFT combines the Adaptive Fractal Tree algorithm’s efficiency (Liu et al. in IEEE Robot Autom Lett 1(2):601–608, . 10.1109/LRA.2016.2528292) with optimized geometric Hermite (Yong and Cheng in Comput Aided Geom Des 21(3):281–301, . 10.1016/j.cagd.2003.08.003) curves, which are able to handle heading constraints.

Results
Simulated results demonstrate the robustness of the AHFT to perturbations of the target position and target heading. Additionally, a simulated preoperative environment, where the surgeon is able to select a desired entry pose on the patient’s skull, confirms the ability of the method to generate multiple feasible trajectories for a patient-specific case.

Conclusions
The AHFT method can be adopted in any field of application where a 3D path planner with kinematic and heading constraints on both start and end poses is required.},

	abstract = {Percutaneous interventions via minimally invasive surgical systems can provide patients with better outcomes and faster recovery times than open surgeries. Accurate needle insertions are vital for successful procedures, and actively steered needles can increase system precision. Here, we describe how biology inspired the design of a novel Programmable Bevel-Tip Needle (PBN), mimicking the mechanics and control methods of certain insects ovipositors. Following an overview of our unique research and development journey, this paper explores our latest, biomimetic control of PBNs and its application to neurosurgery, which we validate within a simulated environment. Three modalities are presented, namely a Direct Push Controller, a Cyclic Actuation Controller, and a newly developed Hybrid Controller, which have been integrated into a surgical visual interface. The results of open loop, expert human-in-the-loop and a non-expert user study show that the Hybrid Controller is the best choice when considering system performance and the ability to lesson strain on the surrounding tissue which we hypothesis will result in less damage along the insertion tract. Over representative trajectories for neurosurgery using a Hybrid Controller, an expert user could reach a target along a 3D path with an accuracy of 0.70±0.69 mm, and non-expert users 0.97±0.72 mm, both clinically viable results and equivalent or better than the state-of-the-art actively steered needles over 3D paths. This paper showcases a successful example of a biologically inspired, actively steered needle, which has been integrated within a clinical interface and designed for seamless integration into the neurosurgical workflow.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in technology have pushed the boundaries of neurosurgery. Surgeons play a major role in the neurosurgical field, but robotic systems challenge the current status quo. Robotic-assisted surgery has revolutionized several surgical fields, yet robotic-assisted neurosurgery is limited by available technology.
METHODS: The literature on the current robotic systems in neurosurgery and the challenges and compromises of robotic design are reviewed and discussed.
RESULTS: Several robotic systems are currently in use, but the application of these systems is limited in the field of neurosurgery. Most robotic systems are suited to assist in stereotactic procedures. Current research and development teams focus on robotic-assisted microsurgery and minimally invasive surgery. The tasks of miniaturizing the current tools and maximizing control challenge manufacturers and hinder progress. Furthermore, loss of haptic feedback, proprioception, and visualization increase the time it takes for users to master robotic systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted surgery is a promising field in neurosurgery, but improvements and breakthroughs in minimally invasive and endoscopic robotic-assisted surgical systems must occur before robotic assistance becomes commonplace in the neurosurgical field.},

Over the last few years, several continuum robotic systems have been launched commercially and have been increasingly adopted in hospitals. Despite the clear progress achieved, continuum robots still suffer from design complexity hindering their dexterity and scalability. Recent advances in actuation methods have looked to address this issue, offering alternatives to commonly employed approaches. Additionally, continuum structures introduce significant complexity in modelling, sensing, control and fabrication; topics which are of particular focus in the robotics community. It is, therefore, the aim of the presented work to highlight the pertinent areas of active research and to discuss the challenges to be addressed before the potential of continuum robots as medical devices may be fully realised.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Intracranial aneurysms are present in roughly 5\% of the population, yet most are often asymptomatic and never detected. Development of an aneurysm typically occurs during adulthood, while formation and growth are associated with risk factors such as age, hypertension, pre-existing familial conditions, and smoking. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most common presentation due to aneurysm rupture, represents a serious medical condition often leading to severe neurological deficit or death. Recent technological advances in imaging modalities, along with increased understanding of natural history and prevalence of aneurysms, have increased detection of asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). Studies reporting on the risk of rupture and outcomes have provided much insight, but the debate remains of how and when unruptured aneurysms should be managed. Treatment methods include two major intervention options: clipping of the aneurysm and endovascular methods such as coiling, stent-assisted coiling, and flow diversion stents. The studies reviewed here support the generalized notion that endovascular treatment of UIA provides a safe and effective alternative to surgical treatment. The risks associated with endovascular repair are lower and incur shorter hospital stays for appropriately selected patients. The endovascular treatment option should be considered based on factors such as aneurysm size, location, patient medical history, and operator experience.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The HRM has the advantages of high flexibility, large workspace, and low inertia, but also poses challenges of complex kinematics, and dynamic coupling. To address these challenges, the kinematics model was developed based on the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption that captures the relationship between the cable lengths, joint angles, and end-effector pose. Inverse kinematics is presented geometrically by solving trigonometric equations. The dynamic model for the continuum robot (CR) is derived using the Euler–Lagrange representation, which incorporates the effects of gravity and elasticity. Accordingly, three control strategies are developed and applied to a two-section continuum robot, which are the inverse dynamic proportional integral derivative controller (PID), fuzzy logic controller (FLC), and sliding mode controller (SMC). We validate our proposed methods through simulations on various 3D trajectories, utilized MATLAB symbolic math toolbox in conjunction with Simulink simulation; demonstrate and evaluate different close-loop dynamic control responses for different scenarios. This simulation used in the creation of a unique animated simulation for a whole 3D continuum robot while tracking its desired trajectories. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods can effectively control the HRM with high tracking performance, exhibiting enhanced responses in terms of settling time, rising time, and steady-state error. While the developed SMC outperforms Poth's PID and FLC in terms of robustness and settling time (51\% and 10.3\%), respectively.},

	abstract = {Soft-bodied robotic manipulators have great potential for use in minimally invasive surgery, owing to their advantages of high flexibility with infinite degrees of freedom (DOF). One of the potential applications is to perform blood suctioning, which is inevitable during the surgery. To attain higher efficiency in suctioning, the robotic tip should remain vertical while moving along on the work surface. Motivated by this application, this article presents a novel soft robot design and its control scheme to properly configure the tip of a two-segment soft robot while following a planned trajectory on the work surface. Aiming to reduce the incision size and the possibility of infection, a 3D-printed soft-bodied manipulator utilizing the cable-driven mechanism with a diameter of 9 mm was designed and fabricated. An additional DOF was added through a motorized insertion stage. The robot system was modeled using piecewise constant-curvature assumption, and an RGB-D vision was employed to enhance the accuracy of the kinematic-based controller. Performances of the tip positioning and verticalizing were evaluated via simulation, and further verified through experiments. The results confirm that the manipulator is capable of following different trajectories at various velocities while keeping its tip vertical. Compared to other similar works, our results are satisfactory with an root-mean-square error of trajectory tracking within 7 mm, and a maximum angular deviation of 6{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ. Fluid suction experiments were conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness for automated 3-D suction. This article offers a new tool to support the surgeons for surgical blood suction.},

Existing algorithms for continuum robot path planning have certain limitations that need to be addressed. These include the fact that none of the algorithms provide safety assurance parameters and control for path planning. They are computationally expensive, applicable to a specific type of continuum robots, and mostly they do not incorporate design and kinematics constraints. In this paper, we propose a points-based path planning (PoPP) algorithm for continuum robots that computes the path by imposing safety constraints and improves upon the limitations of existing approaches. In the algorithm, we exploit the constant curvature-bending property of continuum robots in their path planning process. The algorithm is computationally efficient and provides a good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency that can be implemented to enable the safety-critical application of continuum robots. This algorithm also provides information regarding path volume and flexibility in movement. Simulation results confirm that the algorithm possesses promising potential for all types of continuum robots (following the constant curvature-bending property). We believe that this effectively balances the desired safety and efficiency requirements.},

However, due to its complex kinematics and coupling of joint motion, its motion path planning is also a challenging task. In this paper, a path planning method for Continuum Robot based on an equal curvature model in an aircraft fuel tank environment is proposed. Considering the complexity of calculation and the structural characteristics of Continuum Robot, a feasible obstacle avoidance discrete path is obtained by using the improved RRT algorithm. Then, joint fitting is performed on the existing discrete path according to the kinematic model of Continuum Robot, joint obstacle avoidance was conducted in the process of fitting, and finally, a motion path suitable for the Continuum Robot was selected. A reasonable experiment is designed based on MATLAB, and simulation and analysis results demonstrate excellent performance of this method and feasibility of path planning.},

	abstract = {Continuum robots are highly miniaturizable, exhibit non-linear shapes with several curves, and are flexible and compliant. In particular, concentric-tube and tendon-driven continuum robots can be designed on a small scale with diameters of below 10 mm. A small diameter-to-length ratio enables insertion of these robots through small entry points in order to reach hardly accessible regions by avoiding obstacles. This scenario can often be found in minimally invasive surgery and technical inspections. However, to reach the target region, a deployment along a narrow tortuous path is often required. Common tendon-driven continuum robots are intrinsically incapable of such deployment and concentric-tube continuum robots require special path conditions and intensive parameter optimization. Other proposed robot types, such as hyper-redundant and pneumatically actuated robots, exhibit less favorable diameter-to-length ratios and are thus not suitable for those tasks. Since the limiting factors are found in the design of continuum robots, we propose a novel tendon-driven continuum robot design, which features an additional degree of freedom in each robot section. The backbone is composed of straight, concentrically arranged tubes, each of which composes a section and is used to adapt its length. We present a three-section continuum robot prototype with a diameter of 7 mm, determine its follow-the-leader capabilities theoretically, and validate the results experimentally using model-based control. For our 165 mm long robot prototype, the repeatability is below 2.38 mm. The model accuracy reaches a median of 3.16\% over 25 configurations with respect to robot length. The path-following error over five curvilinear paths results in median errors of 2.59\% with respect to robot length.},

	abstract = {Continuum manipulators possess the ability to travel on nonlinear paths and avoid obstacles in confined environments. A variety of designs were proposed for several applications, such as minimally invasive surgery or inspections and maintenance in hazardous spaces. While hyperredundant robots can follow a path on the large scale, path following behavior on small the scale is still a challenge. Only a limited number of paths can be followed by small continuum robots due to design constraints such as fixed curvatures or fixed segment lengths. For most applications, continuum robot parameters have to be optimized and selected according to specific task and design constraints. This is time consuming and limits the utilization of the manipulator to specific application scenarios. In this work, we propose a hybrid continuum robot design to overcome these disadvantages and offer a universal tool which is able to follow any constant curvature path. The design is comprised of a telescopic composition of several tendon driven patterned elastic tubes. Each one can be translated and bent independently. With this design we achieve improved path deviation errors (max 0.6 mm) in comparison to previously proposed continuum robots in simulation. We prove the path following behavior on random paths with a two segment prototype robot with overall outer diameter of 6 mm in an experimental setup with average path deviation errors lower than 5 mm.},

	abstract = {This article presents an in-depth review of path following control strategies that are applicable to a wide range class of marine, ground, and aerial autonomous robotic vehicles. From a control system standpoint, path following can be formulated as the problem of stabilizing a path following error system that describes the dynamics of position and possibly orientation errors of a vehicle with respect to a path, with the errors defined in an appropriate reference frame. In spite of the large variety of path following methods described in the literature we show that, in principle, most of them can be categorized in two groups: stabilization of the path following error system expressed either in the vehicle's body frame or in a frame attached to a “reference point” moving along the path, such as a Frenet-Serret (F-S) frame or a Parallel Transport (P-T) frame. With this observation, we provide a unified formulation that is simple but general enough to cover many methods available in the literature. We then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method, comparing them from the design and implementation standpoint. We further show experimental results of the path following methods obtained from field trials testing with under-actuated and over-actuated autonomous marine vehicles. In addition, we introduce open-source Matlab and Gazebo/ROS simulation toolboxes that are helpful in testing path following methods before their integration in the combined guidance, navigation, and control systems of autonomous vehicles.},

The strategy is evaluated in simulation on a realistic 3D CAD model of the brain. Results: The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the fornix can be reached along several curved paths from various entry points. As compared with the usual straight line path, these curved paths avoid tissue damage to important neural structures while allowing for a much greater selection of entry points.

The method potentially leads to safer paths and additional entry points capable of reaching the desired stimulation targets.},

	abstract = {Background Despite using a variety of path-finding algorithms that use tracts, the most significant advancement in this study is considering the values of all brain areas by doing atlas-based segmentation for a more precise search. Our motivation comes from the literature’s shortcomings in designing and implementing path-planning methods. Since planning paths with curvatures is a complex problem that requires considering many surgical and physiological constraints, most path-planning strategies focus on straight paths. There is also a lack of studies that focus on the complete structure of the brain with the tracks, veins, and segmented areas. Instrument dependence is another inadequacy of the methods proposed in the literature. Aims The aim of this study is to design a new surgical path planning framework that helps to plan the surgical path independently of the instrument, considers the entire structure of the brain, and allows curvilinear surgical paths. Thus, neurosurgeons can generate patient-specific possible optimal surgical pathways before the neurosurgical procedure. Materials \& Methods The proposed framework includes different path-finding algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, and their aggressive variants) that find optimal paths by taking the risk scores (surgeons assessed all the segmented regions, considering the extent of damage. In this evaluation, scores ranged from “0 to 10,” with the most critical areas receiving a score of “10,” while the least possible affected areas were assigned a score of '0') for sensitive brain areas into consideration. For the tract image processing the framework includes fractional anisotropy (FA), relative anisotropy (RA), spherical measure (SM), and linear measure (LM) methods. Results This is the first paper to handle tracts and atlas-based segmentation of the human brain altogether under a framework for surgical path planning. The framework has a dynamic structure that gives the flexibility to add different path-finding algorithms and generate different widths of surgical pathways. Moreover, surgeons can update the score table to guarantee minimally invasive surgery. The output file format of all the extracted surgical paths is NRRD, so it can be easily visualised, analysed, or processed over the third part software tools. Discussion In this study, we generated many possible surgical pathways then these pathways were evaluated by the surgeons the results were impressive because the framework could identify surgical pathways used in real-world surgery that correspond to the standard pathways such as anterior transsylvian, trans sulcal, transgyral, and sub-temporal. Conclusion This study proposes a new surgical path planning framework for neurosurgery. Moreover, in the future by adding/adopting different parameters (such as operation time, and short and long-term complications after surgery) to the proposed framework, it would be possible to find new surgical pathways for difficult surgical conditions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE  
          Three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound is an intraoperative imaging modality used in neuronavigation as an alternative to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This article summarizes 4 years of clinical experience in the use of intraoperative 3-D ultrasound integrated into neuronavigation for guidance in brain tumor resection.
          METHODS  
          Patients were selected for inclusion in the study on the basis of the size and location of their lesion. Preoperative 3-D MRI data were registered and used for planning as in other conventional neuronavigation systems. Intraoperative 3-D ultrasound images were acquired three to six times, and tumor resection was guided on the basis of these updated 3-D images.
          RESULTS  
          Intraoperative 3-D ultrasound represents a good solution to the problem of brain shift in neuronavigation because it easily provides an updated, and hence more accurate, map of the patient’s true anatomy in all phases of the operation. Ultrasound makes it possible to follow the progression of the operation, and it improves the radicality of tumor resection by detecting tumor tissue that would remain if the imaging technology had not been used (in 53\% of the cases). Integration of 3-D ultrasound with navigation technology solves the orientation problem experienced previously with two-dimensional ultrasound in neurosurgery. The technology makes it possible to directly compare intraoperative ultrasound and MRI data regarding visualization of the lesion. Ultrasound image quality is useful for guiding surgical procedures.
          CONCLUSION  
          Intraoperative 3-D ultrasound seems to provide a time- and cost-effective way to update high-quality 3-D maps used in neuronavigation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE  
          In 1995, a project was initiated in Trondheim, Norway, to investigate various possibilities for more frequent use of ultrasound in brain surgery. Since that time, the quality of ultrasonic images has improved considerably through technological adjustment of parameters. The objective of the present study was to explore essential clinical parameters required for the successful use of ultrasonic guidance in brain surgery.
          METHODS  
          During the study period, several surgical setups designed to optimize the use of intraoperative real-time two-dimensional ultrasonic imaging were explored. These included various positions of the ultrasound probe in relation to both the operation cavity and the lesion, as well as the position of the operation channel in relation to the gravity line.
          RESULTS  
          All lesions from the latest period (1997–2001; n = 114) were depicted well by ultrasound imaging, with the exception of two cases. High image quality and direct image guidance of the tool were maintained best throughout the operation by imaging through an intact dura and at an angle relative to a vertical operation channel. All tumor operations were performed without complications, and ultrasound imaging was found to be an important factor in the detection of remaining tumor tissue at the conclusion of surgery. For 14 low vascular tumors, the operation was guided only by ultrasound imaging. No bleeding complications occurred. A method of minimally invasive ultrasound-guided evacuation of hematomas was developed. In 19 patients, the method was found to be efficient (i.e., {\textgreater}90\% of the hematoma was evacuated) and without complications, except for one patient who experienced rebleeding.
          CONCLUSION  
          With proper planning and surgical setup, ultrasound imaging may provide acceptable image quality for use in image-guided brain operations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We have integrated a neuronavigation system into an ultrasound scanner and developed a single-rack system that enables the surgeon to perform frameless and armless stereotactic neuronavigation using intraoperative three-dimensional ultrasound data as well as preoperative magnetic resonance or computed tomographic images. The purpose of this article is to describe our two-rack prototype and present the results of our work on image quality enhancement. DESCRIPTION OF INSTRUMENTATION: The system consists of a high-end ultrasound scanner, a modest-cost computer, and an optical positioning/digitizer system. Special technical and clinical efforts have been made to achieve high image quality. A special interface between the ultrasound instrument and the navigation computer ensures rapid transfer of digital three-dimensional data with no loss of image quality. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The positioning system tracks the position and orientation of the patient, the ultrasound probe, the pointer, and various surgical instruments. This makes it possible to update the three-dimensional map during surgery and navigate by ultrasound data in a similar manner as with magnetic resonance data.
METHODS: The two-rack prototype has been used for clinical testing since November 1997 at the University Hospital in Trondheim. EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS: The image quality improvements have enabled us, in most cases, to extract information from ultrasound with clinical value similar to that of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. The overall clinical accuracy of the ultrasound-based navigation system is expected to be comparable to or better than that of a magnetic resonance imaging-based system.
CONCLUSION: The SonoWand system enables neuronavigation through direct use of intraoperative threedimensional ultrasound. Further research will be necessary to explore the potential clinical value and the limitations of this technology. (Neurosurgery 47:1373–1380, 2000)},

In this prospective study the authors assess radiological and clinical results in consecutive patients with LGG treated with 3D ultrasound (US)-guided resection under general anesthesia. Methods: Consecutive LGGs undergoing primary surgery guided with 3D US between 2008 and 2015 were included. All LGGs were classified according to the WHO 2016 classification system. Pre- and postoperative volumetric assessments were performed, and volumetric results were linked to overall and malignant-free survival. Pre- and postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated. Results: Forty-seven consecutive patients were included. Twenty LGGs (43\%) were isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated, 7 (14\%) were IDH wild-type, 19 (40\%) had both IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, and 1 had IDH mutation and inconclusive 1p/19q status. Median resection grade was 93.4\%, with gross-total resection achieved in 14 patients (30\%). An additional 24 patients (51\%) had small tumor remnants {\textless} 10 ml. A more conspicuous tumor border (p = 0.02) and lower University of California San Francisco prognostic score (p = 0.01) were associated with less remnant tumor tissue, and overall survival was significantly better with remnants {\textless} 10 ml (p = 0.03). HRQoL was maintained or improved in 86\% of patients at 1 month. In both cases with severe permanent deficits, relevant ischemia was present on diffusionweighted postoperative MRI. Conclusions: Three-dimensional US-guided LGG resections under general anesthesia are safe and HRQoL is preserved in most patients. Effectiveness in terms of EOR appears to be consistent with published studies using other advanced neurosurgical tools.

Unreliable neuronavigation owing to inaccurate patient-to-image registration and brain shift is a major problem in conventional magnetic resonance imaging–guided neurosurgery. We performed a prospective intraoperative validation of a system for fully automatic correction of this inaccuracy based on intraoperative three-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging-to-ultrasound registration.
Methods
The system was tested intraoperatively in 13 tumor resection cases, and performance was evaluated intraoperatively and postoperatively.
Results
Intraoperatively, the system was accurate enough for tumor resection guidance in 9 of 13 cases. Manually placed anatomic landmarks showed improvement of alignment from 5.12 mm to 2.72 mm (median) after intraoperative correction. Postoperatively, the limitations of the current system were identified and modified for the system to be sufficiently accurate in all cases.
Conclusions
Automatic and accurate correction of spatially unreliable neuronavigation is feasible within the constraints of surgery. The current limitations of the system were also identified and addressed.},

	abstract = {Background: We propose a 3D path planning method to steer flexible needles along curved paths in the context of deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedures. Methods: Our approach is based on a rapidly exploring random tree strategy, and it takes into account constraints coming from anatomical obstacles and physical constraints dictated by flexible needle kinematics. The strategy is evaluated in simulation on a realistic 3D CAD model of the brain. Results: The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the fornix can be reached along several curved paths from various entry points. As compared with the usual straight line path, these curved paths avoid tissue damage to important neural structures while allowing for a much greater selection of entry points. Conclusions: This path planning method offers alternative curved paths to reach DBS targets with flexible needles. The method potentially leads to safer paths and additional entry points capable of reaching the desired stimulation targets.},

	abstract = {Mechanics are increasingly recognized to play an important role in modulating brain form and function. Computational simulations are a powerful tool to predict the mechanical behavior of the human brain in health and disease. The success of these simulations depends critically on the underlying constitutive model and on the reliable identification of its material parameters. Thus, there is an urgent need to thoroughly characterize the mechanical behavior of brain tissue and to identify mathematical models that capture the tissue response under arbitrary loading conditions. However, most constitutive models have only been calibrated for a single loading mode. Here, we perform a sequence of multiple loading modes on the same human brain specimen – simple shear in two orthogonal directions, compression, and tension – and characterize the loading-mode specific regional and directional behavior. We complement these three individual tests by combined multiaxial compression/tension-shear tests and discuss effects of conditioning and hysteresis. To explore to which extent the macrostructural response is a result of the underlying microstructural architecture, we supplement our biomechanical tests with diffusion tensor imaging and histology. We show that the heterogeneous microstructure leads to a regional but not directional dependence of the mechanical properties. Our experiments confirm that human brain tissue is nonlinear and viscoelastic, with a pronounced compression-tension asymmetry. Using our measurements, we compare the performance of five common constitutive models, neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Demiray, Gent, and Ogden, and show that only the isotropic modified one-term Ogden model is capable of representing the hyperelastic behavior under combined shear, compression, and tension loadings: with a shear modulus of 0.4–1.4kPa and a negative nonlinearity parameter it captures the compression-tension asymmetry and the increase in shear stress under superimposed compression but not tension. Our results demonstrate that material parameters identified for a single loading mode fail to predict the response under arbitrary loading conditions. Our systematic characterization of human brain tissue will lead to more accurate computational simulations, which will allow us to determine criteria for injury, to develop smart protection systems, and to predict brain development and disease progression.
Statement of Significance
There is a pressing need to characterize the mechanical behavior of human brain tissue under multiple loading conditions, and to identify constitutive models that are able to capture the tissue response under these conditions. We perform a sequence of experimental tests on the same brain specimen to characterize the regional and directional behavior, and we supplement our tests with DTI and histology to explore to which extent the macrostructural response is a result of the underlying microstructure. Results demonstrate that human brain tissue is nonlinear and viscoelastic, with a pronounced compression-tension asymmetry, and we show that the multiaxial data can best be captured by a modified version of the one-term Ogden model.},

This is due to high stress leading to tissue injury, which in turn leads to an immune response coupled with a significant reduction in the nearby neural population and subsequent isolation of the implant. In this work, we develop a finite element model of the intracortical probe-tissue interface to study the effect of implant micromotion, implant thickness, and material properties on the strain levels induced in brain tissue. Our results showed that for stiff implants, the strain magnitude is dependent on the magnitude of the motion, where a micromotion increase from 1 to 10 μm induced an increase in the strain by an order of magnitude. For higher displacement over 10 μm, the change in the strain was relatively smaller. We also showed that displacement magnitude has no impact on the location of maximum strain and addressed the conflicting results in the literature. Further, we explored the effect of different probe materials [i.e., silicon, polyimide (PI), and polyvinyl acetate nanocomposite (PVAc-NC)] on the magnitude, location, and distribution of strain. Finally, we showed that strain distribution across cortical implants was in line with published results on the size of the typical glial response to the neural probe, further reaffirming that strain can be a precursor to the glial response.},

	abstract = {Penetration of a flexible and steerable needle into a soft target material is a complex problem to be modelled, involving several mechanical challenges. In the present paper, an adaptive finite element algorithm is developed to simulate the penetration of a steerable needle in brain-like gelatine material, where the penetration path is not predetermined. The geometry of the needle tip induces asymmetric tractions along the tool–substrate frictional interfaces, generating a bending action on the needle in addition to combined normal and shear loading in the region where fracture takes place during penetration. The fracture process is described by a cohesive zone model, and the direction of crack propagation is determined by the distribution of strain energy density in the tissue surrounding the tip. Simulation results of deep needle penetration for a programmable bevel-tip needle design, where steering can be controlled by changing the offset between interlocked needle segments, are mainly discussed in terms of penetration force versus displacement along with a detailed description of the needle tip trajectories. It is shown that such results are strongly dependent on the relative stiffness of needle and tissue and on the tip offset. The simulated relationship between programmable bevel offset and needle curvature is found to be approximately linear, confirming empirical results derived experimentally in a previous work. The proposed model enables a detailed analysis of the tool–tissue interactions during needle penetration, providing a reliable means to optimise the design of surgical catheters and aid pre-operative planning.},

Using data from these experiments, cohesive elements are calibrated and then implemented in models for validation of the needle insertion process. Successful modelling enables direct comparison of finite element and experimental force–displacement plots and energy distributions.

Previously established ribbon models are extended to handle geodesic curvature, natural out-of-plane curvature, and a variable width. Both the case of a finite width (Wunderlich’s model) and the limit of small width (Sadowksky’s model) are recovered. The ribbon is assumed to remain developable as it deforms, and the direction of the generatrices is used as an internal variable. Internal constraints expressing inextensibility are identified. The equilibrium of the ribbon is found to be governed by an equation of equilibrium for the internal variable involving its second-gradient, by the classical Kirchhoff equations for thin rods, and by specific, thin-rod-like constitutive laws; this extends the results of Starostin and van der Heijden (Nat. Mater. 6(8):563–567, 2007) to a general ribbon model. Our equations are applicable in particular to ribbons having geodesic curvature, such as an annulus cut out in a piece of paper. Other examples of application are discussed. By making use of a material frame rather than the Frenet–Serret frame, the present work unifies the description of thin ribbons and thin rods.},

Using the theory of inextensional ribbons, we present a matched asymptotic analysis of these singularities for ribbons whose width-to-length ratio 𝑤∕𝓁 ≪ 1 is small. An inner layer solution is derived from the finite-𝑤 Wunderlich model and captures the fast, local variations of the bending and twisting strains in the neighbourhood of the cone-like region; it is universal up to a load intensity factor. The outer solution is given by the zero-𝑤 Sadowsky model. Based on this analysis, we propose a new standalone ribbon model that combines the Sadowsky equations with jump conditions providing a coarse-grained description of cone-like singularities, and give a self-contained variational derivation of this model. Applications to the Möbius band and to an end-loaded open ribbon are presented. Overall, the new model delivers highly accurate approximations to the solutions of the Wunderlich model in the limit 𝑤 ≪ 𝓁 while avoiding the numerical difficulties associated with cone-like singularities.},

The behaviors are then compared to that of the brain tissues under identical loading conditions to find candidate gel materials that respond to dynamic loading in a similar manner as the brain tissues.

Thus, to this day, a flexible probe able to bend along predefined curvilinear trajectories within a highly compliant medium without buckling is still an open research challenge. In this paper, we describe the concept of a “programmable bevel” tip, which is inspired by the ovipositor of certain wasps: the offset between two parts of a probe determines the steering direction of the tip thanks to a set of bevels included at the tip of each segment. A kinematic model of the flexible probe and programmable bevel arrangement is derived. Several parameters of the kinematic model are calibrated experimentally using our first prototype of the flexible probe, codenamed STING. Open- (feed-forward) and closed-loop (feedback) control strategies are then derived and implemented in simulation using the chained form representation, originally developed to control car-like robots. Simulated results demonstrate accurate two-dimensional needle steering in the presence of velocity, position, and initial posture disturbances.},

This enables robotic needle steering, which can be used in medical procedures to reach subsurface targets inaccessible by straight-line trajectories. However, accurate path planning and control of needle steering requires models of needle-tissue interaction. Previous kinematic models required empirical observations of each needle and tissue combination in order to fit model parameters. This study describes a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, which can be used to predict needle behavior and optimize system design based on fundamental mechanical and geometrical properties of the needle and tissue. We first present an analytical model for the loads developed at the tip, based on the geometry of the bevel edge and material properties of soft-tissue simulants (gels). We then present a mechanics-based model that calculates the deflection of a bevel-tipped needle inserted through a soft elastic medium. The model design is guided by microscopic observations of needle-gel interactions. The energy-based formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters, and the geometry and material properties of the needle. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in experimental studies of robotic needle insertion.},

In this paper, we consider a first step toward active needle steering: design and experimental validation of a nonholonomic model for steering flexible needles with bevel tips. The model generalizes the standard three degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonholonomic bicycle model to 6 DOF using Lie group theory. Model parameters were fit using experimental data, which were acquired via a robotic device designed for the specific purpose of inserting a flexible needle.

Their narrow curvilinear shape makes them well suited to passing through body lumens, natural orifices, or small surgical incisions to perform minimally invasive procedures. Modeling and controlling these robots are, however, substantially more complex than traditional robots comprised of rigid links connected by discrete joints. Furthermore, there are many approaches to achieving robot flexure. Each presents its own design and modeling challenges, and to date, each has been pursued largely independently of the others. This article attempts to provide a unified summary of the state of the art of continuum robot architectures with respect to design for specific clinical applications. It also describes a unifying framework for modeling and controlling these systems while additionally explaining the elements unique to each architecture. The major research accomplishments are described for each topic and directions for the future progress needed to achieve widespread clinical use are identified.},

Inspired by biological trunks, tentacles, and snakes, continuum robot designs can traverse confined spaces, manipulate objects in complex environments, and conform to curvilinear paths in space. In addition, many designs offer inherent structural compliance and ease of miniaturization. After decades of pioneering research, a host of designs have now been investigated and have demonstrated capabilities beyond the scope of conventional rigid-link robots. Recently, we have seen increasing efforts aimed at leveraging these qualities to improve the frontiers of minimally invasive surgical interventions. Several concepts have now been commercialized, which are inspiring and enabling a current paradigm shift in surgical approaches toward flexible access routes, e.g., through natural orifices such as the nose. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of this field from the perspectives of both robotics science and medical applications.

The model is asymptotically correct and can handle finite rotations. Two popular theories can be recovered as limiting cases, namely Kirchhoff’s rod model for small bending and twisting strains, {\textbar}κi{\textbar}≪t∕a2, and Sadowsky’s inextensible ribbon model for {\textbar}κi{\textbar}≫t∕a2; we point out that Sadowsky’s inextensible model may be a poor approximation even for ribbons having a very thin cross-section (say, with t∕a as small as 0.02). By way of illustration, the one-dimensional model is applied (i) to the lateral-torsional instability of a ribbon, showing good agreement with both experiments and finite-element shell simulations, and (ii) to the stability of a twisted ribbon subjected to a tensile force.

              BACKGROUND
              Modern-day stereotactic techniques have evolved to tackle the neurosurgical challenge of accurately and reproducibly accessing specific brain targets. Neurosurgical advances have been made in synergy with sophisticated technological developments and engineering innovations such as automated robotic platforms. Robotic systems offer a unique combination of dexterity, durability, indefatigability, and precision.
            
            
              OBJECTIVE
              To perform a systematic review of robotic integration for cranial stereotactic guidance in neurosurgery. Specifically, we comprehensively analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a spectrum of robotic technologies, past and present, including details pertaining to each system's kinematic specifications and targeting accuracy profiles.
            
            
              METHODS
              Eligible articles on human clinical applications of cranial robotic-guided stereotactic systems between 1985 and 2017 were extracted from several electronic databases, with a focus on stereotactic biopsy procedures, stereoelectroencephalography, and deep brain stimulation electrode insertion.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Cranial robotic stereotactic systems feature serial or parallel architectures with 4 to 7 degrees of freedom, and frame-based or frameless registration. Indications for robotic assistance are diversifying, and include stereotactic biopsy, deep brain stimulation and stereoelectroencephalography electrode placement, ventriculostomy, and ablation procedures. Complication rates are low, and mainly consist of hemorrhage. Newer systems benefit from increasing targeting accuracy, intraoperative imaging ability, improved safety profiles, and reduced operating times.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              We highlight emerging future directions pertaining to the integration of robotic technologies into future neurosurgical procedures. Notably, a trend toward miniaturization, cost-effectiveness, frameless registration, and increasing safety and accuracy characterize successful stereotactic robotic technologies.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys both the clinical applications and main technical innovations related to steered needles, with an emphasis on neurosurgery. Technical innovations generally center on curvilinear robots that can adopt a complex path that circumvents critical structures and eloquent brain tissue. These advances include several needle-steering approaches, which consist of tip-based, lengthwise, base motion-driven, and tissue-centered steering strategies. This paper also describes foundational mathematical models for steering, where potential fields, nonholonomic bicycle-like models, spring models, and stochastic approaches are cited. In addition, practical path planning systems are also addressed, where we cite uncertainty modeling in path planning, intraoperative soft tissue shift estimation through imaging scans acquired during the procedure, and simulation-based prediction. Neurosurgical scenarios tend to emphasize straight needles so far, and span deep-brain stimulation (DBS), stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG), intracerebral drug delivery (IDD), stereotactic brain biopsy (SBB), stereotactic needle aspiration for hematoma, cysts and abscesses, and brachytherapy as well as thermal ablation of brain tumors and seizure-generating regions. We emphasize therapeutic considerations and complications that have been documented in conjunction with these applications.},

Intensive research is currently being conducted to untangle the complex interplay of failure mechanisms. In this Review, we emphasize the importance of minimizing the physical and mechanical mismatch between neural tissues and implantable interfaces.

	abstract = {Brain tissue is not only one of the most important but also the most complex and compliant tissue in the human body. While long underestimated, increasing evidence confirms that mechanics plays a critical role in modulating brain function and dysfunction. Computational simulations–based on the field equations of nonlinear continuum mechanics–can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of brain injury and disease that go beyond the possibilities of traditional diagnostic tools. Realistic numerical predictions, however, require mechanical models that are capable of capturing the complex and unique characteristics of this ultrasoft, heterogeneous, and active tissue. In recent years, contradictory experimental results have caused confusion and hindered rapid progress. In this review, we carefully assess the challenges associated with brain tissue testing and modeling, and work out the most important characteristics of brain tissue behavior on different length and time scales. Depending on the application of interest, we propose appropriate mechanical modeling approaches that are as complex as necessary but as simple as possible. This comprehensive review will, on the one hand, stimulate the design of new experiments and, on the other hand, guide the selection of appropriate constitutive models for specific applications. Mechanical models that capture the complex behavior of nervous tissues and are accurately calibrated with reliable and comprehensive experimental data are key to performing reliable predictive simulations. Ultimately, mathematical modeling and computational simulations of the brain are useful for both biomedical and clinical communities, and cover a wide range of applications ranging from predicting disease progression and estimating injury risk to planning surgical procedures.},

It is commonly used in clinical settings to mimic voluntary contractions and enhance the rehabilitation of human skeletal muscles. Although the beneficial effects of EMS are widely accepted, discrepancies concerning the specific responses to EMS versus voluntary actions exist. The unique effects of EMS have been attributed to several mechanisms, most notably a reversal of the recruitment pattern typically associated with voluntary muscle activation. This perspective outlines the authors' contention that electrical stimulation recruits motor units in a nonselective, spatially fixed, and temporally synchronous pattern. Furthermore, it synthesizes the evidence that supports the contention that this recruitment pattern contributes to increased muscle fatigue when compared with voluntary actions. The authors believe the majority of evidence suggests that EMS-induced motor unit recruitment is nonselective and that muscle fibers are recruited without obvious sequencing related to fiber types.},

In the first one (MP mode), the cathode was facing the muscle main motor point and stimulus amplitude was set to the level eliciting the maximal myoelectrical activation according to the amplitude of the evoked electromyogram (EMG); in the second one (RC mode), the electrodes were positioned following common reference charts for electrode placement while stimulus amplitude was set according to subject tolerance. Tibialis Anterior (TA) and Vastus Lateralis (VL) muscles of 10 subjects (28.4 ± 8.2 years) were tested in specific dynamometers to measure the evoked isometric torque. The EMG and near-infrared spectroscopy probes were placed on muscle belly to detect the electrical activity and local metabolic modifications of the stimulated muscle, respectively. The stimulation protocol consisted of a gradually increasing frequency ramp from 2 to 50 Hz in 7.5 s. Compared to RC mode, in MP mode the contractile parameters (peak twitch, tetanic torque, area under the torque build-up) and the metabolic solicitation (oxygen consumption and hyperemia due to metabolites accumulation) resulted significantly higher for both TA and VL muscles. MP mode resulted also to be more comfortable for the subjects. Based on the assumption that proper mechanical and metabolic stimuli are necessary to induce muscle strengthening, our results witness the importance of an optimized, i.e., comfortable and effective, stimulation to promote the aforementioned muscle adaptive modifications.},

Although the progress in micro-electro-mechanical systems has improved the qualities of the inertial sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, their bandwidths limits them from accurate measurements and applications. However, by properly using the complementary filter, the signals can be adopted to generate reliable data for positioning. To obtain the best results, the frequency response and transfer of sensors are identified and the cut-off frequency of complementary filter is defined accordingly. To minimize the measurement error caused by the external forces and disturbances, a state estimator has been integrated into the system. To validate the real-time performance of this system, tests are conducted on linear and rotating platforms. The estimated data shows the functionality of this developed complementary filter to blend the high-frequency measurements of gyroscopes and low-frequency ones of accelerometers to generate trustworthy positioning information.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}It has been largely suggested in neuroscience literature that to generate a vast variety of movements, the Central Nervous System (CNS) recruits a reduced set of coordinated patterns of muscle activities, defined as muscle synergies. Recent neurophysiological studies have recommended the analysis of muscle synergies to finely assess the patient's impairment, to design personalized interventions based on the specific nature of the impairment, and to evaluate the treatment outcomes. In this scope, the aim of this study was to design a personalized multi-channel functional electrical stimulation (FES) controller for gait training, integrating three novel aspects: (1) the FES strategy was based on healthy muscle synergies in order to mimic the neural solutions adopted by the CNS to generate locomotion; (2) the FES strategy was personalized according to an initial locomotion assessment of the patient and was designed to specifically activate the impaired biomechanical functions; (3) the FES strategy was mapped accurately on the altered gait kinematics providing a maximal synchronization between patient's volitional gait and stimulation patterns. The novel intervention was tested on two chronic stroke patients. They underwent a 4-week intervention consisting of 30-min sessions of FES-supported treadmill walking three times per week. The two patients were characterized by a mild gait disability (walking speed \&gt; 0.8 m/s) at baseline. However, before treatment both patients presented only three independent muscle synergies during locomotion, resembling two different gait abnormalities. After treatment, the number of extracted synergies became four and they increased their resemblance with the physiological muscle synergies, which indicated a general improvement in muscle coordination. The originally merged synergies seemed to regain their distinct role in locomotion control. The treatment benefits were more evident for one patient, who achieved a clinically important change in dynamic balance (Mini-Best Test increased from 17 to 22) coupled with a very positive perceived treatment effect (GRC = 4). The treatment had started the neuro-motor relearning process also on the second subject, but twelve sessions were not enough to achieve clinically relevant improvements. This attempt to apply the novel theories of neuroscience research in stroke rehabilitation has provided promising results, and deserves to be further investigated in a larger clinical study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Functional electrical stimulation (FES) neuroprostheses have been regarded as an effective approach for gait rehabilitation and assisting patients with stroke or spinal cord injuries. A multiple-channel FES system was developed to improve the assistance and restoration of lower limbs. However, most neuroprostheses need to be manually adjusted and cannot adapt to individual needs. This study aimed to integrate the purely reflexive FES controller with an iterative learning algorithm while a multiple-channel FES walking assistance system based on an adaptive reflexive control strategy has been established. A real-time gait phase detection system was developed for accurate gait phase detection and stimulation feedback. The reflexive controller generated stimulation sequences induced by the gait events. These stimulation sequences were updated for the next gait cycle through the difference between the current and previous five gait cycles. Ten healthy young adults were enrolled to validate the multiple-channel FES system by comparing participants' gait performance to those with no FES controller and purely reflexive controller. The results showed that the proposed adaptive FES controller enabled the adaption to generate fitted stimulation sequences for each participant during various treadmill walking speeds. The maximum, minimum, and range of motion (ROM) of the hip, knee, and ankle joints were furtherly improved for most participants, especially for the hip and knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion compared with the purely reflexive FES control strategy. The presented system has the potential to enhance motor relearning and promote neural plasticity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This paper presents the implementation and validation of a sFES closed-loop position control and the pilot clinical tests with a chronic, motor complete (ASIA B) SCI patient. We demonstrate that the patient can safely use our setup to produce a physiologically correct gait with minimal external help. The implemented sFES-gait training was beneficial to see an improvement in gait kinematics.

Its closed-loop control performance can be potentially affected by the presence of electromechanical delay (EMD) during FES. In this paper, a tracking control scheme for a hybrid walking neuroprosthesis that combines electric motor actuation at the hip and FES actuation at the knee is presented. The knee joint controller uses a delay compensation technique to compensate for EMD during FES. This neuroprosthesis controller is combined within a finite state machine that also features gait detection, wherein force sensors in the foot can detect gait phases and create a fully automated and functional assisted gait cycle. Experiments were performed on an able bodied subject to demonstrate the efficacy of the tracking control scheme. Results from the experiments show a maximum error at the hip of less than 1 degree and a maximum error at the knee of 13.66 degrees. The maximum error at the knee is attributed to overshoot caused by the unidirectional actuation of the FES.},

	abstract = {In the field of transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES), open-loop and closed-loop control strategies have been developed to restore functions of the lower limbs: walking, standing up, maintaining posture, and cycling. These strategies require sensors that provide feedback information on muscle activity or biomechanics of movement. Since muscle response induced by transcutaneous FES is nonlinear, time-varying, and dependent on muscle fatigue evolution, the choice of sensor type and control strategy becomes critical. The main objective of this review is to provide state-of-the-art, emerging, current, and previous solutions in terms of control strategies. Focus is given on transcutaneous FES systems for the lower limbs. Using Compendex and Inspec databases, a total of 135 review and conference articles were included in this review. Recent studies mainly use inertial sensors, although the use of electromyograms for lower limbs has become more frequent. Currently, several researchers are opting for nonlinear controllers to overcome the nonlinear and time-varying effects of FES. More development is needed in the field of systems using inertial sensors for nonlinear control. Further studies are needed to validate nonlinear control systems in patients with neuromuscular disorders.},

Muscle weakness is a common consequence of stroke and can result in a decrease in physical activity. Changes in gait performance can be observed, especially a reduction in gait speed, and increased gait asymmetry, and energy cost is also reported.
Objective
The aim was to determine whether strengthening of the lower limbs can improve strength, balance and walking abilities in patients with chronic stroke.
Method
Five databases (Pubmed, Cinhal, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase) were searched to identify eligible studies. Randomized controlled trials were included and the risk of bias was evaluated for each study. Pooled standardized mean differences were calculated using a random effects model. The PRISMA statement was followed to increase clarity of reporting.
Results
Ten studies, including 355 patients, reporting on the subject of progressive resistance training, specific task training, functional electrical stimulation and aerobic cycling at high-intensity were analysed. These interventions showed a statistically significant effect on strength and the Timed Up-and-Go test, and a non-significant effect on walking and the Berg Balance Scale.
Conclusion
Progressive resistance training seemed to be the most effective treatment to improve strength. When it is appropriately targeted, it significantly improves strength.},

	abstract = {Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can be used to initiate lower limb muscle contractions and has been widely applied in gait rehabilitation. Establishing the correct timing of FES activation during each phase of the gait (walking) cycle remains challenging as most FES systems rely on open-loop control, whereby the controller receives no feedback about joint kinematics and instead relies on predetermined/timed muscle stimulation. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a closed-loop FES-based control solution for gait rehabilitation using a finite state machine (FSM) model. A two-phased study approach was taken: (1) Experimentally-Informed Study: A neuromuscular-derived FSM model was developed to drive closed-loop FES-based control for gait rehabilitation. The finite states were determined using electromyography and joint kinematics data of 12 non-disabled adults, collected during treadmill walking. The gait cycles were divided into four states, namely: swing-to-stance, push off, pre-swing, and toe up. (2) Simulation Study: A closed-loop FES-based control solution that employed the resulting FSM model, was validated through comparisons of neuro-musculo-skeletal computer simulations of impaired versus healthy gait. This closed-loop controller yielded steadier simulated impaired gait, in comparison to an open-loop alternative. The simulation results confirmed that accurate timing of FES activation during the gait cycle, as informed by kinematics data, is important to natural gait retraining. The closed-loop FES-based solution, introduced in this study, contributes to the repository of gait rehabilitation control options and offers the advantage of being simplistic to implement. Furthermore, this control solution is expected to integrate well with powered exoskeleton technologies.},

	abstract = {Background
Walking speed is a confounding factor in biomechanical analyses of gait, but still many studies compare gait biomechanics at comfortable walking speed (CWS) that is likely to differ between groups or conditions. To identify gait deviation unrelated to walking speed, methods are needed to correct biomechanical data over the gait cycle for walking speed.
Research question
How to compare knee kinetics over the gait cycle at different walking speeds?
Methods
22 asymptomatic subjects walked on a dual-belt treadmill at CWS and 4 fixed speeds. Knee moments in sagittal (KFM) and frontal plane (KAM) were calculated via inverse dynamics. The net moment differences between CWS and fixed speed were expressed as a root-mean-square error (RMSE) normalized to the range of the variable. Two methods to correct for walking speed were compared. In method 1, KFM and KAM values were estimated based on interpolation between speeds at each percentage of the gait cycle. In method 2, principal component analysis was used to extract speed related features to reconstruct KFM and KAM at the speed of interest. The accuracy of both methods was tested using a leave-one-out cross validation.
Results
Walking speed influenced the magnitude and shape of KFM and KAM. To account for these speed influences using both methods, leave-one-out cross validation showed low normalized RMSE ({\textless} 5 \%), with little difference between the two methods. RMSE for both reconstruction methods were up to 60 \% lower than the RMSE between CWS and fixed speed.
Significance
Both methods could accurately correct knee kinetics over the gait cycle for the effects of walking speed. Walking speed dependency should be incorporated in each gait laboratory’s reference dataset to be able to identify gait deviations unrelated to gait speed.},

	abstract = {In the field of transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES), open-loop and closed-loop control strategies have been developed to restore functions of the lower limbs: walking, standing up, maintaining posture, and cycling. These strategies require sensors that provide feedback information on muscle activity or biomechanics of movement. Since muscle response induced by transcutaneous FES is nonlinear, time-varying, and dependent on muscle fatigue evolution, the choice of sensor type and control strategy becomes critical. The main objective of this review is to provide state-of-the-art, emerging, current, and previous solutions in terms of control strategies. Focus is given on transcutaneous FES systems for the lower limbs. Using Compendex and Inspec databases, a total of 135 review and conference articles were included in this review. Recent studies mainly use inertial sensors, although the use of electromyograms for lower limbs has become more frequent. Currently, several researchers are opting for nonlinear controllers to overcome the nonlinear and time-varying effects of FES. More development is needed in the field of systems using inertial sensors for nonlinear control. Further studies are needed to validate nonlinear control systems in patients with neuromuscular disorders.},

	abstract = {Transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation applied in clinical settings is currently characterized by a wide heterogeneity of stimulation protocols and modalities. Practitioners usually refer to anatomic charts (often provided with the user manuals of commercially available stimulators) for electrode positioning, which may lead to inconsistent outcomes, poor tolerance by the patients, and adverse reactions. Recent evidence has highlighted the crucial importance of stimulating over the muscle motor points to improve the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Nevertheless, the correct electrophysiological definition of muscle motor point and its practical significance are not always fully comprehended by therapists and researchers in the field. The commentary describes a straightforward and quick electrophysiological procedure for muscle motor point identification. It consists in muscle surface mapping by using a stimulation pen-electrode and it is aimed at identifying the skin area above the muscle where the motor threshold is the lowest for a given electrical input, that is the skin area most responsive to electrical stimulation. After the motor point mapping procedure, a proper placement of the stimulation electrode(s) allows neuromuscular electrical stimulation to maximize the evoked tension, while minimizing the dose of the injected current and the level of discomfort. If routinely applied, we expect this procedure to improve both stimulation effectiveness and patient adherence to the treatment.},

	abstract = {Abstract: A major limitation of many functional electrical stimulation (FES) applications is that muscles tend to fatigue very rapidly. It was hypothesized that FES-induced muscle fatigue could be reduced by randomly modulating the pulse frequency, amplitude, and pulse width in a range of ±15\%. Seven subjects with spinal-cord injuries participated in this study. FES was applied to quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles using surface electrodes. Isometric force was measured, and the time for the force to drop by 3 dB (fatigue time) was compared between trials. Four different modes of FES were applied in random order: constant stimulation, randomized frequency, randomized amplitude, and randomized pulse width. There was no significant difference between the fatigue-time measurements for the four modes of stimulation (P = 0.329). Therefore, random modulation appeared to have no effect. Based on an observed correlation between maximum force measurements and trial order, we concluded that having 10-min rest periods between trials was insufficient.},

This study considers the use of shank and thigh inertial sensors within three different filtering algorithms to estimate the knee flexion angle for running without requiring sensor-to-segment mounting assumptions, body measurements, specific calibration poses, or magnetometers. The objective of this study is to determine the knee flexion angle within running applications using accelerometer and gyroscope information only. Data were collected for a single test participant (21-year-old female) at four different treadmill speeds and used to validate the estimation results for three filter variations with respect to a Vicon optical motion-capture system. The knee flexion angle filtering algorithms resulted in root-mean-square errors of approximately three degrees. The results of this study indicate estimation results that are within acceptable limits of five degrees for clinical gait analysis.

	abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation ﬁlter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The ﬁlter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The beneﬁts of the ﬁlter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each ﬁlter update, (2) eﬀective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters deﬁned by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the ﬁlter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online.

The EKF exploits the measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that is integrated with a tri-axial magnetic sensor. Magnetic disturbances and gyro bias errors are modeled and compensated by including them in the filter state vector. We employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives to verify the conditions under which the nonlinear system that describes the process of motion tracking by the IMU is observable, namely it may provide sufficient information for performing the estimation task with bounded estimation errors. The observability conditions are that the magnetic field, perturbed by first-order Gauss-Markov magnetic variations, and the gravity vector are not collinear and that the IMU is subject to some angular motions. Computer simulations and experimental testing are presented to evaluate the algorithm performance, including when the observability conditions are critical.},

	abstract = {This contribution is concerned with joint angle calculation based on inertial measurement data in the context of human motion analysis. Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles. Therefore, we focus on methods that avoid assuming certain orientations in which the sensors are mounted with respect to the body segments. After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1° on the prosthesis and about 3° on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1°.},

Fifty-three subjects of both genders (age range: 18–50 years) were recruited. The muscle motor points were identified for the following ten muscles of the lower limb (dominant side): vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus lateralis of the quadriceps femoris, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus of the hamstring muscles, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, lateral and medial gastrocnemius. The muscle motor point was identified by scanning the skin surface with a stimulation pen electrode and corresponded to the location of the skin area above the muscle in which an electrical pulse evoked a muscle twitch with the least injected current. For each investigated muscle, 0.15 ms square pulses were delivered through the pen electrode at low current amplitude ({\textless}10 mA) and frequency (2 Hz). 16 motor points were identified in the 10 investigated muscles of almost all subjects: 3 motor points for the vastus lateralis, 2 motor points for rectus femoris, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, and tibialis anterior, 1 motor point for the remaining muscles. An important inter-individual variability was observed for the position of the following 4 out of 16 motor points: vastus lateralis (proximal), biceps femoris (short head), semimembranosus, and medial gastrocnemius. Possible implications for electrical stimulation procedures and electrode positioning different from those commonly applied for thigh and leg muscles are discussed.},

	abstract = {Muscles are usually stimulated by shocks delivered at some constant rate. However, human thenar motor units generate optimum force per pulse when excited by impulse trains that begin with one or two short interpulse intervals ("doublets"), followed by longer intervals. Our aim was to determine whether the rate of force and force-time integral reduction during fatigue of thenar muscles is influenced by an initial doublet, and/or the number of pulses per train. We first matched thenar force-time integral using two different pulse patterns, one of which began with a doublet. Fatigue induced by trains that contained a doublet resulted in slower rates of force and force-time integral reduction and smaller increases in half-relaxation time than that evoked by bursts of 40-HZ stimulation. When the force was measured in each protocol after equal numbers of pulses had been delivered, the force loss was still significantly less for pulse trains containing a doublet. These results have useful implications when designing stimulation to strengthen weak muscles or to drive paralyzed muscles.},

	abstract = {This thesis is the first to be carried out within the framework of the project "Cyberthosis for Paraplegics" in progress at the "Laboratoire de Systèmes Robotiques" (LSRO) of the "Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne" (EPFL). This project, initiated in 1999 by the "Fondation Suisse pour les Cyberthèses" in Villeneuve (FSC), is based on the reflections on the current means of physical rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries people. Eager to bring new methods of rehabilitation, the FSC initiated a program focused on the development of rehabilitation devices and overground walking assistance devices, associating an orthotic system with the electrical muscle stimulation. The main objective is to create an active muscular participation while preserving the physiological dynamic effects of the movements and thus to accelerate the process of rehabilitation. Three developments corresponding to three successive phases of rehabilitation are envisaged. A. MotionMaker™: stationary system for mobilization and muscular reinforcement. B. WalkTrainer™: mobile equipment allowing overground locomotion to stimulate neural plasticity and relearn walking. C. WalkMaker™: Assistance device for autonomous walking. The first stage of this thesis was to validate, on the knee joint, the closed loop control of electrically stimulated muscles with the information provided by an orthotic system. To do this, a robotic knee was designed. An electric motor controls the knee bending/extension, with resistance or assistance to the movement. Integrated sensors transmit, in real time, the values torques and articular positions to the dataprocessing programs which control the orthosis and the associated stimulator. This allows the adjustment of the resistance during movement and the adjustment of the electrical stimulation of the quadriceps muscles according to the kinematics and dynamics chosen. With this prototype we demonstrated the feasibility of closed loop control of electrically-stimulated muscles on able-bodied people as well as on people with spinal cord injuries. In a second stage, a more complete device, the MotionMaker™, was developed. It comprises two orthoses for the lower limbs. In the current state, the control unit allows the management of the 3 articulations (hip, knee and ankle) and of 7 muscles on each side (rectus femoris, vastus medialis and lateralis, gluteus maximus, semimembranosus and semitendinosus, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius). Several algorithms of electrical stimulation control were proposed and evaluated in this thesis. They are either based on a mathematical model of the 7 muscles according to the stimulation current and the joint positions or on an iterative learning control. The development of this cyberthosis is currently sufficiently advanced to carry out, on able-bodied subjects, leg-press movements with control of the strength provided by the electrically-stimulated muscles. Thus the outcome push forces on the feet follow the values defined for the exercise. This work is focused on the movement of both above mentioned devices and on the model and the control of the electrical muscle stimulation. The mechanical parts have not been designed by the author.},

Methods: Six electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Epistemonikos, PEDro, COCHRANE Library, and Scopus) were searched for studies evaluating the effects of FES on spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters in healthy individuals. Two examiners evaluated the eligibility and quality of the included studies using the PEDro scale. Results: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings from the literature reveal that FES can be used to modify lower-limb joint kinematics, i.e., to increase or reduce the range of motion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. In addition, FES can be used to alter kinetics parameters, including ground reaction forces, center of pressure trajectory, or knee joint reaction force. As a consequence of these kinetics and kinematics changes, FES can lead to changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters, such as gait speed, step cadence, and stance duration. Conclusions: The findings of this review improve our understanding of the effects of FES on gait biomechanics in healthy individuals and highlight the potential of this technology as a training or assistive solution for improving gait performance in this population.},

Since then, functional electrical stimulation has evolved into an important therapeutic intervention that clinicians can use to help individuals who have had a stroke or a spinal cord injury regain their ability to stand, walk, reach, and grasp. With an expected growth in the aging population, it is likely that this technology will undergo important changes to increase its efficacy as well as its widespread adoption. We present here a series of functional electrical stimulation systems to illustrate the fundamentals of the technology and its applications.

The key elements presented in our review encompass a catalog of the applications developed to date, the specifics of the stimulation parameters used, the participant demographics of the studies, and the types of measures used in these research efforts. We discovered that EMS offers a versatile range of applications in AR/VR, from simulating physical interactions like touching virtual walls or objects to replicating the sensation of weight and impact. Notably, EMS has shown effectiveness in areas such as object handling and musical rhythm learning, indicating its broader potential beyond conventional haptic feedback mechanisms. However, our review also highlights major challenges in the research, such as inconsistent reporting of EMS parameters and a lack of diversity in study participants.

	abstract = {Muscle force was studied as a function of stimulus parameters, epimysial electrode position relative to nerve supply, and muscle length to provide insight into the properties of motor prostheses that employ epimysial electrodes. The results of the acute experiments indicated that the dependence of recruitment (force versus stimulus amplitude) on muscle length was minimal for a monopolar electrode positioned close to nerve entrance or 5 mm proximal to the motor point. The selectivity of stimulation (minimal activation of adjacent muscles) was best, and the recruitment rate the highest, for an electrode placed close to the nerve entrance. A bipolar pair of electrodes placed on the superficial surface of the muscle opposite to the nerve entrance gave better selectivity than the monopolar electrode at the low end of the recruitment range, and poorer selectivity at the high end. This electrode configuration required greater stimulus currents and exhibited a lower recruitment gain than was obtained for a monopolar electrode in the same position. Examination of tissue surrounding the electrode 30 days after implantation showed that the fibrous tissue encapsulating the electrode had been incorporated into the fascial layer. Slightly larger dependence on muscle length and lower selectivity of stimulation were measured after encapsulation than were measured in the acute experiments.},

	abstract = {Electromyostimulation (EMS) incorporates the use of electrical current to activate skeletal muscle and facilitate contraction. It is commonly used in clinical settings to mimic voluntary contractions and enhance the rehabilitation of human skeletal muscles. Although the beneficial effects of EMS are widely accepted, discrepancies concerning the specific responses to EMS versus voluntary actions exist. The unique effects of EMS have been attributed to several mechanisms, most notably a reversal of the recruitment pattern typically associated with voluntary muscle activation. This perspective outlines the authors' contention that electrical stimulation recruits motor units in a nonselective, spatially fixed, and temporally synchronous pattern. Furthermore, it synthesizes the evidence that supports the contention that this recruitment pattern contributes to increased muscle fatigue when compared with voluntary actions. The authors believe the majority of evidence suggests that EMS-induced motor unit recruitment is nonselective and that muscle fibers are recruited without obvious sequencing related to fiber types.},

	abstract = {Paralyzed or paretic muscles can be made to contract by applying electrical currents to the intact peripheral motor nerves innervating them. When electrically elicited muscle contractions are coordinated in a manner that provides function, the technique is termed functional electrical stimulation (FES). In more than 40 years of FES research, principles for safe stimulation of neuromuscular tissue have been established, and methods for modulating the strength of electrically induced muscle contractions have been discovered. FES systems have been developed for restoring function in the upper extremity, lower extremity, bladder and bowel, and respiratory system. Some of these neuroprostheses have become commercialized products, and others are available in clinical research settings. Technological developments are expected to produce new systems that have no external components, are expandable to multiple applications, are upgradable to new advances, and are controlled by a combination of signals, including biopotential signals from nerve, muscle, and the brain.},
